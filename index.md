# Java Workshop

## Introduction

### Identifiers (names given to methods, variables, classes etc)

Java identifiers can start with a letter (A to Z or a to z), dollar sign ($) or an underscore (_). No numbers or other characters!

After the first character, identifiers can contain letters, digits, underscore, and dollar signs in any order.

A keyword cannot be used as an identifier.

Java identifiers are case sensitive.

Which of these options do you think could be used as a name for a java identifier?

_HelloWorld_
123HelloWorld
$helloworld
class

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/hanna-ry/java_workshop/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/hanna-ry/java_workshop/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
